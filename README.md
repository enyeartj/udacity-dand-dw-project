# Data Wrangling with MongoDB Project

This is the third project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. This project
focuses on the skills taught in the [Data Wrangling with MongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032-nd)
course. For the project, we were asked to download [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data
for a location of our choosing. We were then tasked with cleaning up the data, converting it to JSON format for import into MongoDB,
and exploring the data via MongoDB queries and aggregation pipelines.

Auditing of the data was performed with [audit.py](https://github.com/enyeartj/udacity-dand-dw-project/blob/master/audit.py).

Data cleaning and import were performed with [data.py](https://github.com/enyeartj/udacity-dand-dw-project/blob/master/data.py).

Regular expressions and associated functions were used in both audit.py and data.py. These can be found in [osmREs.py](https://github.com/enyeartj/udacity-dand-dw-project/blob/master/osmREs.py). 

Exploration of the data was performed with [explore.py](https://github.com/enyeartj/udacity-dand-dw-project/blob/master/explore.py).
